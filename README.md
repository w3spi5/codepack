## How was I inspired to create such a package ?

This afternoon in January 2025, I'm using [claude](https://claude.ai/) and I have to continually open new chats because a message informs me that using the same chat window consumes more and more tokens, then in fact, between For us, it's true that coming back months later on a 3 km long chat is never very appreciable. And since you have to give Claude the context each time and the manual extraction is boring, that's it! I started coding a program in bash, Claude and o1 helped me fix the bugs and improve the program (even if Claude seems to be a level above), and the result is a project that I am proud of because that it meets my expectations exactly and it only took me 3 hours to create all of this. Enjoy and don‚Äôt hesitate to contribute!
